/*
Assignment (Problem): This page was originally SSR and fully implemented.
- All rendering and data fetching have been intentionally removed.
Your task:
1) Keep this page as SSR.
2) Fetch GET /api/concerts/{id} on the server using the provided `client`.
3) Render the header, venue info, price list, and a checkout link.
4) Avoid hydration issues (e.g., date formatting) and keep imports server-safe.
